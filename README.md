- 👋 Hi, I’m @Spauldo11
- 👀 I’m interested in hockey and coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and Machine Learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on large projects with real-world applications
- You will notice that on December 15, 2025, there was a rather large number of commits to my github. That is because I refactored my entire page and had to commit all of my projects again. Not much new was coded this day
